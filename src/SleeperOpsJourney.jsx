          <Section title="The Problem I Kept Seeing in Enterprise">
            <p>
              After 10 years working with enterprise information systems‚Äîincluding complex Oracle Cloud implementations‚ÄîI witnessed the same frustrating pattern over and over: brilliant organizations crippled by operational inefficiencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Large companies would spend millions on sophisticated technology, yet their teams were still drowning in manual processes. Sales prospects waited days for responses. Managers spent hours each week on data entry that should have been automated. Critical opportunities slipped through the cracks because information lived in disconnected silos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The irony was striking: these companies had access to enterprise-grade solutions that could solve their operational bottlenecks, but implementation was so complex and expensive that most departments just worked around the problems instead of solving them.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="The Small Business Revelation">
            <p>
              When I started consulting with smaller businesses, I discovered they were facing identical operational challenges‚Äîbut with none of the enterprise resources to solve them. A local insurance agency owner was personally screening every job applicant, spending 15+ hours per week on recruiting alone. A real estate team was losing hot prospects because their lead response time was measured in days, not minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              These weren't technology problems‚Äîthey were operational efficiency problems. The same bottlenecks I'd seen paralyze Fortune 500 companies were now strangling the growth of passionate entrepreneurs who simply didn't have the resources to implement enterprise solutions.
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-[#3787b9] pl-6 italic text-[#3787b9] bg-[#3787b9] bg-opacity-10 p-4 rounded-r-lg">
              "I realized that operational efficiency shouldn't be a luxury reserved for large corporations‚Äîevery growing business deserves systems that work as hard as they do."
            </blockquote>
          </Section>

          <Section title="The Competitive Advantage Gap">
            <p>
              What struck me most was the competitive advantage gap this created. While small businesses were manually processing leads over 2-3 days, their competitors with better systems were responding in 30 seconds. Manual processes weren't just inefficient‚Äîthey were business killers in competitive markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              I saw talented business owners trapped in operational quicksand: working harder instead of smarter, losing opportunities to faster competitors, and burning out from repetitive tasks that should have been automated years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's when I founded SleeperOps with a clear mission: bring enterprise-level operational intelligence to growing businesses without the enterprise complexity or cost.

          <Section title="Our First Success: Insurance Agency Transformation">
            <p>
              Our first major client project validated everything I believed about operational efficiency. A local insurance agency was drowning in manual recruiting processes‚Äîthe owner was personally reviewing every resume, scheduling every interview, and following up with every candidate. The operational bottleneck was preventing business growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built an intelligent recruiting system that automatically screens candidates, sends assessments to qualified prospects, and schedules interviews with top candidates. The results spoke for themselves:

              <h4 className="font-semibold text-[#0a2c4d] mb-4">Measurable Business Impact:</h4>
              <ul className="space-y-2 text-[#2c5282]">
                <li><strong>‚è∞ 87% reduction</strong> in manual screening time</li>

              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              This wasn't just about saving time‚Äîwe had eliminated a critical operational bottleneck that was preventing the business from scaling. The owner went from being trapped by manual processes to having a competitive advantage in talent acquisition.

          <Section title="The Methodology That Changes Everything">
            <p>
              Through working with clients across different industries‚Äîinsurance, real estate, financial services‚ÄîI developed a systematic approach to operational efficiency that consistently delivers results:

                <p className="text-sm text-[#2c5282]">Most businesses focus on symptoms, not root causes. I analyze time cost, opportunity cost, and error cost to find the biggest operational drain.</p>

          <Section title="Why This Work Matters to Me">
            <p>
              As a business owner and father myself, I understand the pressure of trying to grow a business while managing everything manually. I've seen too many talented entrepreneurs get stuck in operational quicksand‚Äîworking 60-hour weeks on tasks that should take 15 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every small business owner I work with reminds me why this mission matters: they didn't start their business to spend their days on data entry and manual processes. They started it to serve customers, solve problems, and build something meaningful.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I help a business owner reclaim 15 hours per week or win deals by responding faster than competitors, I'm not just solving a technical problem‚ÄîI'm helping them build the business and life they actually want.

          <Section title="The Universal Truth About Operational Bottlenecks">
            <p>
              Through working with businesses across different industries, I've discovered a universal truth: every growing business faces remarkably similar operational challenges. The specific processes may be different, but the core bottlenecks are almost identical:
            </p>
            <div className="bg-[#3787b9] bg-opacity-10 rounded-xl p-6 border border-[#3787b9] border-opacity-30 my-6">
              <ul className="space-y-3 text-[#2c5282]">
                <li><strong>‚è∞ Time bottlenecks:</strong> Manual processes that don't scale with growth</li>
                <li><strong>üìû Response bottlenecks:</strong> Slow follow-up that loses opportunities to faster competitors</li>
                <li><strong>üìä Information bottlenecks:</strong> Data trapped in disconnected systems</li>
                <li><strong>üîÑ Quality bottlenecks:</strong> Errors and inconsistencies from manual processes</li>
                <li><strong>üéØ Decision bottlenecks:</strong> Lack of real-time business intelligence</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              The businesses that eliminate these bottlenecks don't just become more efficient‚Äîthey gain sustainable competitive advantages that compound over time.
